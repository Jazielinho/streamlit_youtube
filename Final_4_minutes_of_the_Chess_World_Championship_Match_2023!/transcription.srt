1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,040
not to allow Queen for check although

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,259
probably doesn't change much

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,179
my goodness King H2 is played and look

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,760
at the eval bar it's going near level

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,798
this could be dangerous for for ding if

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,320
he's all In For the Win he could find

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,778
himself under pressure with his G7 Pawn

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,879
targeted by the bishop on D4 as well

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:23,278
yeah I mean like Bishop D4 C2 maybe you

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,778
lose because of Queen uh to F7 something

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,118
like that obviously you never you never

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,859
want to allow but generally speaking

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,079
black does not risk here but Bishop D4

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,359
the point of the King on H2 Queen E4 was

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,299
not checked because Queen takes B4 wins

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,140
a piece 17 seconds

17
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:41,640
and that was correct one wait A3 and

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,140
oh is he going back queen of seven Queen

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,719
B3

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,480
or is it a queen of Southern Queen C4

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,280
yeah uh Queen G6 is available I think

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,538
that's what you we're indicating that

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,100
pawns protecting he goes Queen C7 which

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,359
is a mistake a huge mistake in time

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,160
travel from Beyond the Palm Tree the

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,019
queen has to go back to G6 that's the

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,238
good news for dingley red he has only

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,640
one move here and Jan is the one down to

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,399
20 seconds and counting down

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,200
wait Bishop C3

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,820
oh which is A2 and queen B1 then there's

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,900
no checks yeah yeah that's

33
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,899
yeah I think this is over

34
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,438
only move

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,600
will he find it the only way to keep the

36
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,879
game going is Queen back to C4 going

37
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,978
after the bishop he plays just that so

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,978
good find C2 now yeah this is

39
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,118
oh my gosh so close to disaster

40
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,819
but he's holding on right now oh is

41
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,519
Bishop C5 oh no it's not I was trying to

42
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,959
get too clever Bishop D6 this H4 Pawn

43
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,599
may be hanging in some positions he goes

44
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,339
King G2 which keeps it in -3 so that's

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,319
obviously an advantage for black but

46
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,060
maybe it's time Fabi for your H5 move

47
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,399
just because you don't want this King to

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,460
be checked uh left and right you know

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,020
non-stop so maybe H5 helps that King

50
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,239
just to stop white because white is

51
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,280
there any H5 now a white has a threat of

52
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,759
H5 H5 queen of five G4 and the queen has

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,978
to lose contact with C2 Pawn H5

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,780
uh might not be an easy decision because

55
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,399
you feel like if my Queen ever gets

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,379
active then white will Target that H

57
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,318
Pawn definitely a difficult decision

58
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,239
well it might be the right move

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,219
if he plays H5 why we'll play Queen to

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,280
D5

61
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,840
H5 Queen D5 oh I was gonna say A2 but

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,280
you can just take my Pawn yeah it

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,560
doesn't work that works there's Queen E4

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,479
take this bishop oh yeah he can actually

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,979
play A2 immediately

66
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,780
although you'd be very careful here

67
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,699
let's see King F1 oh I don't think the

68
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,560
king of the belongs the first rank that

69
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,458
means a pawn might promote with check at

70
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,439
some point

71
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,259
wait now King E2 Queen G4 so you can't

72
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,239
move your king oof but he was avoiding

73
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,159
this A2 Queen E4 Queen E3 because he saw

74
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,259
that option he was avoiding it with King

75
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,000
F1 oh wait now Bishop to B2 is coming

76
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,039
this is just game over I mean there's no

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,900
more hope here the bishop on V2 white

78
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,479
doesn't even have counter play

79
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,459
he's going for just desperation

80
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,039
with a H5 Queen F5 yeah this is

81
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,860
desperation is not working out ding is

82
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,079
going to win this match unbelievable

83
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,940
the resilience from dingley Ren he

84
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,440
brings his Queen up now it's on F5

85
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,639
there's a pass Pawn C2 that's defended

86
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,739
you can't distract the queen anymore

87
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,419
dingly run who is down a point in this

88
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,659
match is he about to become a world

89
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,659
champion

90
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,799
uh well I can do anything here

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,739
I mean he doesn't have to panic but he

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
can play A2 uh

93
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,219
in D3 probably wins G3 probably wins

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,480
yeah and now A2 A2 is super super

95
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,060
winning

96
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,219
not even hope he's left just seconds

97
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,199
away from ding becoming the world

98
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,080
champion if he just plays the next few

99
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:41,000
accurate moves it's all over

100
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,000
just one move A2 and it's over

101
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,640
oh my goodness and yeah

102
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,719
up in his chair but he knows this might

103
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,798
be the last few moves of his world

108
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
