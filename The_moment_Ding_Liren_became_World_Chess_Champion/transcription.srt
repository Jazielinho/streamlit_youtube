1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
we are expecting a repetition at this

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,778
point we're doing falling back with the

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,339
King to G8 Rook G6 is not a move that

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:09,839
you consider here right it's the only

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,460
move that I feel with black keeps the

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,500
game going but it looks like more like a

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,599
losing move than a winning attempt

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,899
the fruit G6 is not better for what I'd

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,019
be shocked but it's not definitely oh my

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,019
God what

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,279
for a win

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,160
the rent tried to win this game because

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,259
this is a big moment the bishop on E3 is

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,000
pinned the Queens are looking at each

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,359
other through that Bishop so if you

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,359
can't take on C5 black is up a pawn and

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,399
dingley Wren I keep using this Hemingway

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,558
uh expression you know he said courage

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,539
is Grace Under Pressure he's courageous

20
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:46,979
and queen of five use black the upper

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,558
hand apparently

22
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,599
yeah is he just pushing but but wait why

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,878
would white black be better here

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,879
uh you push with C4 yeah that's

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,899
actually C4 C4 is

26
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:02,578
on the board why it's got to go H4 H5

27
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,960
right that's the plan but black stops it

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,180
with H5

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,460
or queen G4 as well you could try to

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,618
trade Queens you are up two queen side

31
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,599
passers and we keep talking about Blitz

32
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,640
this is about to be a Blitz game where

33
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,500
yonda palmchi is currently up almost a

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,719
minute but he is down a pawn and those

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,920
are some scary pawns to be down I'm in

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,079
absolute shock that Ding actually

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
decided to continue the game with just a

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,759
minute on the clock he's refused their

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,500
repetition going into Blitz

40
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,478
yeah this is a pretty wild decision

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,978
Maybe

42
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,659
it actually looks like a brilliant

43
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,078
decision but probably because this queen

44
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,118
F5 was was a mistake

45
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,319
um and maybe he just missed C4 he

46
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,239
thought he's picking up that pawn but

47
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,758
he's not picking up that pawn

48
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,739
so what does he do Bishop

49
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,280
D4

50
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,899
I just want to stop C3 there

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,060
Queen D3 yeah

52
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,540
yeah Queen D3

53
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,780
oh my gosh this is a position where Jan

54
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,880
might have only one move to survive I I

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,739
see the eval bar saying 0.3 but that is

56
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,599
completely misleading everybody there

57
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,459
are two separate pass pawns most

58
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,799
importantly there's Advanced C pawn and

59
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,680
you want to rush upon H5 you do not get

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,420
that the queen steps to G4 after Pawn HR

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,239
offering a queen trade and then the pawn

62
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,098
goes up to C3 Bobby Tanya this is

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,480
worrisome territory for Jana Pomchi

64
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,459
who's dipping to just about a minute and

65
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,818
that was a mistake

66
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,979
oh Queen D3 not even Queen G4 Queen D3

67
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,738
that's the best way

68
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,179
yeah that that's really really bad for

69
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,640
white

70
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,400
oh my goodness the C3 is happening move

71
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,979
Rook G6 we were thinking that's not even

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,560
a possibility and such a brave decision

73
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,659
and it's paying off ding Loren with the

74
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,000
reval bar it shows that he's clearly

75
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,979
better better here but practically Fabi

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,719
how easy is this in um with a minute on

77
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,340
the clock and Jan there keeps the Queens

78
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,280
on the board which is absolutely crucial

79
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,439
for any play with white he has to get H5

80
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,759
in Rook D1 like it's just pushing like

81
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,959
what does the H5 matter because you

82
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,518
don't give checks on the diagonal

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,780
anymore

84
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,659
like

85
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,620
oh

86
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,780
okay

87
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,680
C3 F6

88
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,780
it doesn't seem to change a huge amount

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,580
yeah what are you doing here as white

90
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,919
because the queen on D3 is so well

91
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,940
positioned and I he goes Rook D1 he

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,339
wants to chase the Queen off the

93
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,680
diagonal I think that's a good choice

94
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,840
just slide back to F5 and then Queen C4

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,700
he has to to engineer some sort of Rook

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,219
d8 Rook D5 like something with activity

97
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,199
oh but I like this because if Queen C4

98
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,939
this Rook C6 now the queen and Rook

99
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,259
along the sixth rank helps to push the

100
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,239
pawn

101
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,620
that's a good move so wait does the

102
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,620
Queen have to go to E2

103
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,439
but that's not what you want to do

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,140
because then Rook C6 anyway with the

105
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,239
threat of C2 Bishop to A3 and he's also

106
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:57,598
has no time

107
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:59,340
oh wow so yeah this is very very close

108
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,439
oh my goodness we're stunned into

109
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,939
silence maybe you need to play Queen E2

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,878
quickly and just pray

111
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,318
I mean obviously your position is bad

112
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,539
uh but at least keep some time on the

113
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,699
clock he's down to 35 seconds ding's the

114
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,679
one with the time Advantage Fabi

115
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,179
yeah well white has to keep some time on

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,879
the clock just in case it turns into a

117
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,100
mess at some point wait now Rook C6 what

118
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,899
is even the idea is he gonna try to

119
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,939
sacrifice a piece and go for an attack

120
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,439
against this King that should not pan

121
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,439
out but maybe this Kings have tried to

122
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,660
hide on H2 and in a scramble if it gets

123
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,978
into real time trouble for black when

124
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,120
you under attack that's when mistakes

125
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,279
happen

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,759
yeah maybe good practical shot I mean

127
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,859
for sure this psac is his idea uh it

128
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,360
doesn't work like all these things are

129
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,740
definitely true but

130
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,319
like

131
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,560
he wants to avoid it so

132
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,360
we're now Rook to C1 at least

133
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,500
or wait can you trade maybe you could

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,939
trade

135
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,620
oh let's give him a question mark you

136
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,418
can trade and then try to get your queen

137
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,040
back to E4 at some point try to make it

138
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:02,279
just try to like hold a move by move

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,540
yeah Queen E4 Queen C4 and it's not an

140
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,159
it's not a media drawer but you're

141
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,660
saying black cannot easily progress

142
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,360
because the

143
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,600
and he finds it here we need four Queen

144
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,639
G6 Queen C4 good good try

145
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,560
and not only C2 a good practice let's

146
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,900
try sorry Fabi but look at the eval bar

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,660
it says minus 1.4 or is it nearly minus

148
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:23,219
four so Jan may be fighting back in this

149
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,620
game just when it looked like dingley

150
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,000
Wren would be crowned world champion

151
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,759
well it's very difficult to advance that

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,839
pawn because C2 is allowing H5 ideas

153
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,520
and if not C2 then maybe you play H5

154
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,879
with black here maybe you really need to

155
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,139
get those light squares under control

156
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,939
okay you can give a check it probably

157
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,340
doesn't change a whole lot because you

158
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:46,439
want to stop anything

159
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,459
pushing the a pawn maybe maybe but then

160
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,379
Bishop to

161
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,299
somewhere Bishop D4 will get some

162
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,620
counter play Maybe King goes to H2 not

163
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,800
to allow Queen E4 check although

164
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,019
probably doesn't change much

165
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,180
goodness King H2 is played and look at

166
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,399
the eval bar it's going near level this

167
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,439
could be dangerous for for a ding if

168
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,138
he's all In For the Win he could find

169
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,418
himself under pressure with his G7 Pawn

170
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,639
targeted by the bishop on D4 as well

171
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,799
yeah I mean like Bishop D4 C2 maybe you

172
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,060
lose because of Queen uh to F7 yeah

173
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,740
something like that obviously you never

174
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,600
you would never want to allow but

175
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,639
generally speaking black does not risk

176
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,259
here but Bishop D4 the point of the King

177
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,939
on H2 Queen E4 was not checked because

178
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:29,580
Queen takes B4 wins a piece 17 seconds

179
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:32,279
and that was correct one wait A3 and

180
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,839
oh is he going back queen of seven Queen

181
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,418
B3

182
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,119
or is the queen of Southern Queen C4

183
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,918
yeah uh Queen G6 is available I think

184
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,240
that's what you we're indicating the

185
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,799
pawns protected he goes Queen 27 which

186
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,000
is a mistake a huge mistake in time

187
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,800
travel from Beyond the Palm Tree the

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,660
queen has to go back to G6 that's the

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,879
good news for dingley red he has only

190
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,340
one move here and Jan is the one down to

191
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,100
20 seconds and counting down

192
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,959
wait Bishop C3

193
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,520
oh which is A2 and queen B1 man there's

194
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,439
no checks yeah yeah that's

195
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,659
yeah I think this is over

196
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,100
oh my God Queen C4 back it's the only

197
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,080
only move

198
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,240
will he find it the only way to keep the

199
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,459
game going is Queen back to C4 going

200
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,620
after the bishop he plays just that so

201
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,620
good find C2 now yeah this is

202
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,060
so close to disaster

203
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,639
what he's holding on right now is Bishop

204
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,519
C5 oh no it's not I was trying to get

205
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,720
too clever Bishop D6 this H4 Pawn may be

206
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,060
hanging in some positions he goes King

207
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,440
G2 which keeps it in minus three so

208
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,720
that's obviously an advantage for black

209
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,978
but maybe it's time Fabi for your H5

210
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,919
move just because you don't want this

211
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:40,019
King to be checked uh left and right you

212
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,159
know non-stop so maybe H5 helps that

213
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:42,659
King

214
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,759
just to stop white because white is

215
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,800
there any H5 now it white has a threat

216
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,460
of H5 H5 queen of five G4 and the queen

217
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,620
has to lose contact with the C2 Pawn H5

218
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,478
uh might not be an easy decision because

219
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,098
you feel like if my Queen ever gets

220
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,800
active then white will Target that H

221
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:01,019
Pawn definitely a difficult decision but

222
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,879
might be the right move

223
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,859
if he plays H5 why we'll play Queen to

224
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,379
D5

225
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,639
H5 Queen do you find the oh I was gonna

226
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,439
say A2 but you can just take my Pawn

227
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,300
yeah it doesn't work that works because

228
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:13,740
Queen E4 take this bishop

229
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,180
oh yeah he can actually play A2

230
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,620
immediately

231
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,478
although you'd be very careful here

232
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,399
let's see King F1 oh I don't think the

233
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,258
king in the belongs the first rank that

234
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,098
means a pawn might promote with check at

235
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,199
some point

236
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,079
wait now King E2 Queen G4 so you can't

237
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,120
move your king but he was avoiding this

238
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,218
A2 Queen E4 Queen E3 because he saw that

239
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,379
option he was avoiding it with King F1

240
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,820
boy now Bishop to B2 is coming this is

241
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,918
just game over I mean there's no more

242
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,659
hope here the bishop on V2 white doesn't

243
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,179
even have counter play

244
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:44,158
he's going for just desperation

245
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,739
for the H5 Queen F5 yeah this is

246
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,559
desperation is not working out ding is

247
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,778
going to win this match unbelievable

248
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,639
the resilience from dingley Ren he

249
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,139
brings his Queen up now it's on F5

250
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,338
there's a pass Pawn C2 that's defended

251
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,379
you can't distract the queen anymore

252
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,120
dingley run who is down a point in this

253
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,799
match is he about to become a world

254
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,919
champion

255
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,059
foreign

256
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,620
do anything here

257
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,439
I mean he doesn't have to panic but he

258
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,440
can play A2 oh

259
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,160
Queen D3 probably wins G3 probably wins

260
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,180
yeah

261
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:20,338
and now A2 A2 is super super winning

262
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,739
not even hope he's left we're just

263
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,600
seconds away from thing becoming the

264
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,959
world champion if he just plays the next

265
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,720
few accurate moves it's all over

266
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:33,299
I just want to move A2 and it's over

267
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,540
and it's on the board

268
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:38,039
oh my goodness

269
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:39,299
he sits up in his chair but he knows

270
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,500
this might be the last few moves of his

271
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:42,500
world championship oh my God

272
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,600

yeah Bishop takes F4 is easy

275
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,060
