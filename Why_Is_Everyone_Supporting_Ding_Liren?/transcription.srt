1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,459
we sometimes think of Chess Grand

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:08,039
Masters as machines able to calculate

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,859
and remember all the possible moves in a

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,798
position but when ding Lee Ren froze in

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:16,079
game 7 of the world championship causing

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,879
him to lose it made viewers realize that

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,320
we are dealing with people that have

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,179
spent a huge amount of their life

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,939
polishing their skills and following

10
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,618
their passion for chess sure most of us

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,839
cannot relate to being a chess

12
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,759
Grandmaster but we can relate to

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,219
freezing or struggling Under Pressure

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,439
that is what made the support for ding

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,839
even more heartwarming and to be honest

16
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,959
I wasn't familiar with ding as a player

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,940
or his history so I asked myself why is

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,179
ding so beloved in the chess community

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:48,299
and here's what I found ding lyron born

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:51,960
in 1992 is the highest rated Chinese

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,939
chess Grandmaster in history that on its

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,539
own is an amazing feat but he doesn't

23
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,939
stop there in July 2016 with a blitz

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,579
rating of 2875

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,399
5 he managed to become the highest rated

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,900
Blitz player in the world and right now

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,939
he is competing for the world

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,640
championship but to the chess Community

29
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,618
ding is more than his achievements it's

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,540
normal for Grandmasters to shine on the

31
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,280
board but they also have a way of

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,860
attracting people with their

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,140
personalities take Magnus Carlson for

34
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,420
example he is the best player in the

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,640
world but a lot of people love him for

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,340
his trolling and sometimes really clever

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,439
jokes another one is Hikaru while known

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,020
in the Chess World as the best defender

39
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,839
he's also known for liking drama a bit

40
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:39,658
too much but ding is often accompanied

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,180
with humility when asked about his

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,340
preparation for game one he said I

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,280
didn't prepare anything yesterday

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,200
because I'm struggling with my my

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,239
feelings my emotions you can tell from

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
the interview and the games that Ding is

47
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,500
a very emotional person who is under

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,780
great stress but that doesn't stop him

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,578
from trying his best when asked about

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,739
the reason of there being so many

51
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,258
decisive matches in the tournament ding

52
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,298
replied by being humble and saying maybe

53
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,038
we are not professional like Magnus

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,780
while the question might have been out

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,059
of place ding managed to keep things

56
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,759
respectful and lighthearted but this

57
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,400
interview of game 8 made everyone fall

58
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:21,000
for dank my climatechess.com my question

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,379
is for Grandmaster ding Loren

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,520
um I suspect you might know this is

61
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,340
coming

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,159
some people online have found games

63
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,620
played on Lee chess that match very

64
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:35,459
closely with some games played here

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,659
what is your reaction to this rumor

66
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,659
I don't know I don't know

67
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,959
ding drew the match with white and he

68
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,719
very well could have attributed the draw

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,939
to the leaked preparation but he did not

70
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,979
he did not ruin Ian's lead in the

71
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,039
tournament to the chess community that

72
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,780
is worthy of respect besides that a lot

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,699
of people started to feel bad that this

74
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,979
happened to him but this leak also

75
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,139
caused an explosion of support for ding

76
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,359
that you don't really see that often in

77
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,039
chess I have recently seen a lot of

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
support for ding to win it all and

79
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,239
honestly I feel the same after all who

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,239
doesn't love an Underdog Story
