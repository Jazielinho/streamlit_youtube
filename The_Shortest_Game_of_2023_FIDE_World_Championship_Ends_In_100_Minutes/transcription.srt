1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,879
yeah I think Robert you you called it

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
right before the game started it's it

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,240
this is the d word

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,940
we're heading for a draw

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,740
you know I there's there's no reason to

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,259
writ look he's trading everything off he

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,060
had a slightly better position he could

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,160
have played on but what he is doing is

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:23,719
he's simplifying the Queens are about to

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,719
come off so just to draw

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,339
seven

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,900
and he comes back with the Rook 35

13
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:32,759
that's a Ted Time repetition we will see

14
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,899
the players call out for an Avida to

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,259
check that

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,939
as it's not allowed to offer a draw in

17
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,640
this position so the Orbiter would

18
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,920
usually come and ensure that in fact the

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,259
position has been repeated Thrice

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,300
a little awkward pause there between Yan

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:53,000
ending as they wait for the Orbiter to

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,000
arrive the game has ended in a draw

23
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,239
are they supposed to be in a few seconds

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,799
yeah it's funny they have to ask for

25
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,439
permission to make a draw when they're

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,538
very obviously in a position that is uh

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,518
drawn and yeah there's the handshake it

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,500
is a split point which means Jana

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,500
palmshi keeps his one point advantage
